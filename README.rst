===================================================================================================

By A. David.

Repository of the code used in the paper “Effects of the geometry on the downstream conductance in quantum Hall-superconductor hybrid systems” 
available on arXiv. A documentation of the code is available on `Read the Docs <https://2deg_qh-sc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_.


Content description
-------------------

- **calculations.py**: run calculations.
- **manuscript_figures.py**: generate manuscript figures.
- **documentation**: documentation of the code.
- **files**: data and plots generated by `calculations.py`.
- **modules**: python modules to run the simulations.
- **figures**: figures as used in the manuscript.



Installation and Usage
----------------------

Here we explain how to run the scripts. 
After following the steps below try to run some calculations 
with the script *calculations.py* or reproduce the manuscript 
figures with the script *manuscript_figures.py*. 



Miniconda, GitHub repository and conda environment
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

First install `miniconda <https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html>`_.
Clone the `repository <https://github.com/akdavid/2deg_QH-SC/>`_, unzip it and 
and ``cd`` into the root directory *2deg_QH-SC-main* from the terminal.
Then create the Conda environment that contains all dependencies with ::

   conda env create -f environment.yml


You can now use this environment to run the scripts.
Below is detailed how to run the scripts using the command line,
Pycharm or Visual Studio Code.

Running the scripts by using the command line
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To run a script from the terminal use the following command line: ::

   <path_to_python_exe> <path_to_python_script>

The python executable  should be located at :

      ~/opt/miniconda3/envs/2deg_QH-SC/bin/python (macOS)

      ~/miniconda3/envs/2deg_QH-SC/bin/python (Linux)

      ~/miniconda3/envs/2deg_QH-SC/python (Windows)

For example, if you are on macOS and you want to run the script
*calculations.py* (while being in the root directory of the repo), use ::

    ~/opt/miniconda3/envs/2deg_QH-SC/bin/python calculations.py


.. NOTE::

   You can use a global shell variable to create a shortcut to the Python executable path.
   For that, open a terminal and modify the bash configuration file (.bashrc, .bash_profile, or .profile) located in your 
   HOME directory (the directory in which you are when you open the terminal). For example on macOS ::
 
       nano .bash_profile

   Add the following in the file ::
   
       export mypython=~/opt/miniconda3/envs/2deg_QH-SC/bin/python

   and save it with ``Ctrl+X`` and ``Y`` and ``Enter``. 
   Then close the terminal and open a new one to make the modification effective. 
   You can now use the variable ``$mypython``
   for the path such that the above example reads ::
   
       $mypython calculations.py



Running the scripts by using PyCharm
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

With `PyCharm <https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/>`_ you can follow these steps :

1. Launch PyCharm and choose ``Create New Project`` 
2. **Locate the project** at the root directory *2deg_QH-SC-main*.
3. Mark ``Existing interpreter`` (or ``Previously configured interpreter``)
   and click on the selection icon ``...``
4. Select ``Conda Environment`` and choose the location of the python executable.
   It should be located at :

      /opt/miniconda3/envs/2deg_QH-SC/bin/python (macOS)

      /miniconda3/envs/2deg_QH-SC/bin/python (Linux)

      /miniconda3/envs/2deg_QH-SC/python (Windows)

5. Click on ``Ok`` then on ``Create`` and select ``Create from existing sources``
6. You are ready to run the scripts!
7. (Optional) You can see progress bars during the calculations by activating the
   ``Emulate terminal in output console`` option. For that, got to ``Run->Edit Configurations``
   and check the option.



Running the scripts by using Visual Studio Code
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

With `Visual Studio Code <https://code.visualstudio.com/download/>`_ you can follow these steps :

1. Launch Visual Studio Code and install the *Python* extension if it is not done yet.
2. From the main page choose ``Open...`` , select the root directory *2deg_QH-SC-main*, and click on
   ``Yes, I trust the authors``
3. Open the *Command Palette* with ``Ctrl+Shift+P``, search
   ``Python: Select Interpreter`` and choose the one associated to the '2deg_QH-SC'
   environment.
4. You are ready to run the scripts!



Updating the documentation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The *documentation* directory contains a ``pdf`` and a local ``html`` version of the documentation.
They can respectively be found at *documentation/build/latex/2deg_qh-sc.pdf*
and *documentation/build/html/index.html*. You can update them by using ::

   conda activate 2deg_QH-SC
   cd documentation
   make html
   make latexpdf


.. NOTE::

   When you compile the documentation it runs the python scripts so make sure
   the calculations are commented before using ``make html`` or ``make latexpdf``.
